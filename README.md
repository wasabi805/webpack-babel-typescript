# Initial Webpack Set Up | 01

## To Get Started ...

Core Concepts: go throught this page to have a minimal set up for webpack.config.js | [core concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry)

Basic Set up : this will walk you through the bundling process to have the html page you'll move from src into dist load in the browser |
[basic set up](https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/)

Note: in the the Basic Set up section, if lodash isn't working for you, use javascript join() instead.
You'll still need to npm install lodash --save-dev.
Continue through the docs and by the end, you should be able to have webpack recognize lodash from the node_modules by the end.
